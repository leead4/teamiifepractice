***********
This is a boilerplate iife that should accomplish the major points of the sandwich maker iife assigment with a few bugs here and there that need attention.

##Bug Fixes

* the current showSandwich() method prints to the dom underneath previous prints....
make a function that clears the output area to only show the most updated sandwich order

* right now the sandwhich toppings are being stored as strings in an array 
I want to be able to add my sandwiches to an order, change them, or remove them if I want to ...so I think it would make more sense to store my sandwiches in object form 




##New Features 

* The user has a total order which shows them their drinks, sandwich and sides 
as well as the total cost of their order

* The User is able to add drinks and sides to their order
populate the Drink.js and Sides.js with functions similar to those in Meat.js
you'll need to update the UI so that the user can select the drink and side menu and see a list of the available options 

* The user should be able to remove items from their order as well as make changes to their sandwich object
